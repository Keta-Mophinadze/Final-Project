                            The literal translation of the word “yoga,” which is from Sanskrit (recognized as the original language of yoga) is “union,” says Sherwin. And that is an apt way to describe yoga as we know it today, she says. “We define it as bringing together the mind and the body by use of the breath.”

                            There&#39;s nothing wrong with this - It&#39;s the natural conditioning of the mind to wander. When this happens, simply notice what it is you were thinking about or what was distracting you, then take a moment and pause. let go of whatever it was you were thinking about, reopen your attention, then gently return your awareness to the breath, being present for each inhalation and exhalation.

                            Yin yoga is a style in which there&#39;s no flowing from pose to pose. You stay mostly seated on the floor or lying on your back or belly, Fleming says. It&#39;s more passive and focuses on stretching. And the poses are held longer than in other types of yoga.

                            Hatha yoga encompasses several types of yoga, including ashtanga, vinyasa, and power yoga. Hatha classes tend to be slower-paced than vinyasa classes, and may not necessarily flow from pose to pose. Poses are typically held for several breaths before another pose begins.

                            Kundalini yoga combines postures, breathing, meditation, and the chanting of mantras. Traditionally, kundalini yoga is meant to “awaken” the different energies inside each of us and heighten consciousness.

                            Ashtanga yoga is a physically demanding type of yoga that moves quickly from pose to pose. Unlike flow or vinyasa yoga, there are set sequences that are meant to be performed in a specific order. Ashtanga yoga can be practiced in a teacher-led class or in a Mysore format.
